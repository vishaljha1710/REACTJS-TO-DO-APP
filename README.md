# React TO-Do-APP
This is a simple react app that provides user interface to create new tasks.
- User can add new task from add button.
- User can mark tasks as completed by clicking on tick box , and delete task using the cross icon.
- All changes are saved to local storage so as each time user opens the app the tasks are shown as he/she left them.

## Setup

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
